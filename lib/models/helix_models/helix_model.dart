          '''The Helix project is a partnership between Institute of Critical Languages and Cultural Exchange, Incorporated, Southern University Continuing Education, ENSTAB University, and West Baton Rouge School System to establish a sustainable educational transition from institutions of higher education to the elementary and high schools in the country of Tunisia. 


The overarching goal is to close the educational gaps that threaten democracy within the country.  This project will establish a collaboration to address and overhaul infrastructure, technology, capacity building, international studentsâ€™ exchange, and research initiatives. 


This collaboration aims to assist in the repair of the Tunisian educational system in order to lead to career and college readiness for all students.  Furthermore, this project will help to service historically underserved populations, regardless of race, gender, physical ability, income, or geographic location.''')
